## Exercice 1
I used regex module to split datasets over a matching condition. Regex has been compiled before the script enters the loop for better performance.

## Exercice 2
The are many modules out there that lets you define your graph/tree. However I felt like the exercise was asking for a personal tree implementation. This why I came out with a simple Node class representing a tree node. This class has two methods, one to insertNode as children and another that lets you traverse the tree from a root node in the specified order.
The script `main.py` will output results as requested.

# Run script
